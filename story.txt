A small, orange cat was making its way down the main road ("Hauptstrasse").
This cat found a Rammstein on the ground.
Using this Rammstein, the cat broke into the local Baeckerei
Overwhelmed by all the delicious Gebaeck, the cat became very hungry. 
Unfortunately the cat ran into a gard Hund,and had to run away. 
The cat was very dissapointed, because his entire life all he wanted was a Apfelkuchen to call his own. 
The cat decided that he wouldn't let the Apfelkuchen get away this time and ran around to the back of the Baeckerei, hoping he wouldn't find a Schloss.
