A small, orange cat was making its way down the main road ("Hauptstrasse").
This cat found a Rammstein on the ground.
Using this Rammstein, the cat broke into the local Baeckerei
Overwhelmed by all the delicious Gebaeck, the cat became very hungry. 
Unfortunately the cat ran into a guard Hund,and had to run away. 
The cat was very dissapointed, because his entire life all he wanted was a Apfelkuchen to call his own. 
The cat decided that he wouldn't let the Apfelkuchen get away this time and ran around to the back of the Baeckerei, hoping he wouldn't find a Schloss.
Relieved at the lack of a Schloss, the cat took a moment to rest in the Baeckerei's Klimaanlage.
While resting, the cat noticed a delicious looking Apfelkuchen just a few feet away, but was noticed by a mehlhase.
But, the cat was so tired he didnâ€™t notice the Flughafen Brot turned into a Ratskeller Apfelkuchen, and he felt well, exactly how one would after such an event occurs.
The cat decided this Baeckerei was too much for him to handle, and thus he decided to leave in his Porsche, filled with beautiful girl cats wearing Dirndls.
He pulled up his big boy Lederhose, and decided that going to get some Bratwurst may be his best bet. With all the lovely female cats with him, they rode off on the Hauptstrasse.
On the way there the cat decided to treat his lovely female cats to some apfelstrudels and apfelkuchens.
While driving on the Hauptstrasse, the orange cat saw Schloss Eltz off in the distance and was distracted by its beauty driving off the road towards the busy Flughafen!
