A small, orange cat was making its way down the main road ("Hauptstrasse").
This cat found a Rammstein on the ground.
Using this Rammstein, the cat broke into the local Baeckerei
Overwhelmed by all the delicious Gebaeck, the cat became very hungry. 
Unfortunately the cat ran into a gard Hund,and had to run away.
